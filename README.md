# asteroid-spawning-and-death
An optional project of the "More C# Programming and Unity" course of the "C# Programming for Unity Game Development" Specialization by the University of Colorado via Coursera

## Description

Project Description

You're still building the simplified version of the classic arcade game Asteroids. You won't actually complete the full version of the game until the next course, but game developers typically break their game development into a number of increments. This project is the third increment in your development of this game.

In this project, you'll implement asteroid spawning and collisions between the ship and asteroids.

Specifically, your solution needs to:

    Spawn 4 asteroids that move into the screen from the middle of the top, bottom, left, and right sides

    Make sure the asteroids don't collide with each other but do collide with the ship

    Destroy the ship when it collides with an asteroid

Testing Your Game

Here are the rubrics we used in previous versions of the course to confirm that the game functioned correctly:

    Asteroids enter the screen from around the middle of all 4 side

    Asteroids are moving into the screen as they enter the screen

    Asteroids don't collide with asteroids

    Asteroids collide with the ship

    The ship disappears when it collides with an asteroid
